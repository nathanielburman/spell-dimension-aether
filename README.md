# spell-dimension-aether
Describes the aether dimension and aspects of the physical properties that are present.

AEther Light Relative Dimension:

When you first see Eather aether dimension it looks like an organic layer over the light.

You can notice a more organic motion like blob over the light source completely.

Like a blob of light.

This signals to you that the dimension has shifted.

Aether is what magic is made of. 

Fire does extend into the aether too. Fire will behave differently too.

Other shapes and light distortions can be noticed if you look carefully.

Also there are blob like bubbles that I just forgot about completely.

Aether realms and dimensions exist in observable space.

Mind matters.

This organic structure is light and blobs of fluid.

There are people that can swim through this space.

It exists both inside our minds and actually in our space.

The difference between the mind space and actual space disappears completely.

But this is a very organic time fluid space.

There are organic apparitions and organ string connections.

It is exactly like this reality, but the light shifts and the space gets colder.

The physics engine is different in this space. The mind can be suffocated slightly.

Blobs of matter float up and down in a fluid like layer in front of your face.

Blobs of gold sparkles. Spheres of brilliance in color and outline. Leaving trails in some wake of time and organic flow.
